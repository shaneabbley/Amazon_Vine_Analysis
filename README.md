# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

### Background
In this module we analyzed the effect of Amazon Vine on review quality and quantity. Amazon Vine is a required review service for amazon products. We used Pyspark, AWS, and Postgres SQL to clean and upload the amazon review data to a database. We then analyzed the results using Pandas.
